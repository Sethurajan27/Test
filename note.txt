Integrating with a captcha-solving service generally involves these steps:
Choose a Captcha Solving Service:
There are many services available (e.g., 2Captcha, Anti-Captcha, CapMonster, DeathByCaptcha). You'll need to research and choose one that fits your needs and budget. Most of these services are paid.
Obtain API Key:
Once you sign up for a service, you'll typically receive an API key. This key is crucial for authenticating your requests to their API.
Identify the Captcha Type:
Determine what kind of captcha you're dealing with (e.g., reCAPTCHA v2/v3, hCaptcha, image captcha, FunCaptcha). The integration method will vary based on the captcha type.
Send Captcha Data to the Service:
For image captchas: You'll usually need to take a screenshot of the captcha image or extract the image data, then send it to the captcha-solving service's API.
For reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha: You'll typically need to extract the sitekey (also known as data-sitekey) from the webpage and the URL of the page. You send these to the service.
Receive the Solved Captcha:
The captcha-solving service will process your request and, after a short delay (while a human or AI solves it), return the solution.
For image captchas: They'll return the text recognized from the image.
For reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha: They'll return a token (a long string of characters) that you need to submit with your form.
Submit the Solved Captcha:
For image captchas: Use Playwright to fill the input field with the text you received from the service.
For reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha: This is usually more complex. You'll need to find the hidden input field where the captcha token is expected (often named g-recaptcha-response for reCAPTCHA) and use Playwright to set its value with the token you received. Sometimes, you might need to execute JavaScript on the page to submit the token.
General Workflow in your Python script with Playwright:
Detect Captcha: Implement logic to detect if a captcha is present on the page.
Extract Captcha Information: Use Playwright to locate the captcha element and extract necessary information (e.g., image src, sitekey).
Make API Request: Send the extracted information to the chosen captcha-solving service's API using a library like requests.
Wait for Solution: Implement a mechanism to wait for the solution from the service (e.g., polling their API).
Inject Solution: Once you receive the solution, use Playwright to interact with the web page and input the solved captcha.
Continue Automation: Proceed with your script.
This is a general overview, and the specifics will depend heavily on the captcha-solving service you choose and the type of captcha you encounter. You'll need to refer to the documentation of your chosen captcha-solving service for precise API integration details.
